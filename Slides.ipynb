    "First up, switching between edit mode and command mode. Edit mode allows you to type into cells while command mode will use key presses to execute commands such as creating new cells and openning the command palette. When you select a cell, you can tell which mode you're currently working in by the color of the box around the cell. In edit mode, the box and thick left border are colored green. In command mode, they are colored blue. Also in edit mode, you should see a cursor in the cell itself.\n",
